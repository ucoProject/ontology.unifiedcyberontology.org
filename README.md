# Automated Documentation Deployment


## Description

This repository provides automatic building and deployment of documentation resources
for the UCO ontology ([unifiedcyberontology.org](https://unifiedcyberontology.org)). Using this repository will allow an operator to pull the latest release, build [gendocs](https://github.com/lambdamusic/Ontospy) output, and serve the content via a Linux machine using [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org). 


## Contributions

[CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) contains details on how to submit changes to this repository, and how to deploy the baseline configuration of the repository which you can build and test the effects of those changes. The deployment portion assumes you are using a Debian-based system (and has been tested on Ubuntu), with Apache2 and an active network connection.
